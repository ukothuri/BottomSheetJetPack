# BottomSheetContent Project with MainActivity Integration

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a bottom sheet in an Android application using Jetpack Compose. The key feature is the `BottomSheetContent` composable function, integrated into the `MainActivity`. This setup creates a user interface for a bottom sheet that can be toggled via a button on the main screen.

## Features

- **BottomSheetContent**: A composable function that creates a UI for the bottom sheet.
- **MainActivity**: Integrates the bottom sheet into the app's main screen, allowing users to toggle its visibility.

## Setup

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ukothuri/BottomSheetJetPack.git
   ```
2. **Open Project in Android Studio**: Start Android Studio and open the project by selecting the project directory.
3. **Run the Application**: Use the AVD Manager to run the application on an emulator or connect a physical device to run the app.

## Usage

The `MainActivity` sets the content view to `MainScreen`, which includes a button to toggle the visibility of the bottom sheet. The `BottomSheetContent` composable is used to define the content of the bottom sheet.

Example usage in `MainActivity`:
```kotlin
class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContent {
            MainScreen()
        }
    }
}

@OptIn(ExperimentalMaterialApi::class)
@Composable
fun MainScreen() {
    // ... Implementation details ...
}
```
